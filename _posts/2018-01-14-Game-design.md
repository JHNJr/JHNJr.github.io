Game design

Today in ICT I found out that we were going to be doing a games design course where we were going to plan and make a game from scratch in Scratch. I am doing a game about an alien invasion where you have to kill the aliens before they reach the base. This is my game design. 

Base defender

This game will be a shooting game where the player has to stop the aliens from getting to the base. There will be the possibility for player to buy new shooters from the shop with in game coins. You will get coins for shooting aliens and tougher aliens will get more points.

I will need 5 sprites initially and then more for extra figures.

This game will be aimed for children aged 3+.

I look forward to sharing it with you
