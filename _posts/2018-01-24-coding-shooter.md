Coding shooter

Today in ICT we were coding our games. Mine was already started so I got a head start. I also found out that I am allowed to put proper songs onto my game. I am thinking of some ACDC  to get the aggressive feel of a shooter game. Either that or the Darkness, I will have to decide.

So far I have coded the title screen for the help/play button, the introduction to the game

(where it sets everything up) and the gun appears when needed. I have 2 more weeks to finish so I will have to get a move on because I still need to code the shop, the high score table, the pause button and the gun.

Wish me luck!
