E-safety

Today in ICT I missed most of the lesson because I was at a sport event but I managed to arrive in the lesson with 5 minutes left. We were doing e-safety posters to inform people how to stay safe online. I have nearly finished mine so I sadly cannot post it on this Blog but I will try to remember to post it on next week's blog.
