Penultimate week of scratch!

This week we were reviewing other people's work and adding points to improve on. These were my comments…

**Tester One **

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Pros</td>
    <td>Cons</td>
    <td>Improvements</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The game looks very eye catching, and it's very easy to master.</td>
    <td>It’s quite easy to hit the aliens as the aiming is slightly inaccurate.</td>
    <td>You might want to make the aiming system more specific, as currently, you can aim around them and they’ll still die.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Tester Two **

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Pros</td>
    <td>Cons</td>
    <td>Improvements</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>An excellent game, i really love it, and it gives me ideas on trying to code this in my spare time at home.</td>
    <td>it is super easy to kill things, and maybe, if you have the potential, which i know you do, yp#ou could code super aliens every 30 seconds. But it was incredible.</td>
    <td>As i said, you have the potential to have super mobs, because the game is a little short. It will make the game more interesting.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


As you can see, people think that it is good so far but to step it up a level to become excellent I need to make the game longer and add `super' aliens
