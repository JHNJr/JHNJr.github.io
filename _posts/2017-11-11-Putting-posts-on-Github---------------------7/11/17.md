**Putting posts on Github****                     ****7/11/17**

Today in Computer science, my class and I learned how to put posts on our blog. We have been working on main body of our blogs until now trying to make them look as cool as possible.

First we learned about Gabriel; the site we will be using to post our blogs. We did a test run to see what you did and finding it was quite easy, we eagerly watched as Mr Keen(Our computer science teacher ) explained to us how to continue practicing when the bell went.

Overall we learned an important skill and if you are reading this I have mastered it. If not I haven't.
