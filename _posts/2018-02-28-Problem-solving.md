Problem solving

Today in IT we were using Google Blockly games maze. There are 10 levels to complete each progressively difficult. Most people in my form managed to get to level 10 and some even completed it! I will post the link so anyone who wants a try canâ€¦ 

[https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze?lang=en&level=10&skin=0](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze?lang=en&level=10&skin=0)

The game also showed me how to look for possibilities and solutions. At the end of a level it shows you the java script of the code that you just made so the programme taught me a bit of java script. I will carry on trying to complete level 10 and will notify you when I have completed it
