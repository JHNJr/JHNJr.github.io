Social media

Today in computer science we were learning about the pros and cons of social media.  We thought that it was good because we got to talk to our friends while we were at home but  we also agreed that it is dangerous because anyone can post anything with not many things to stop that happening. We then arranged 12 cards in order of 1-12 with 1 being a really bad idea and 12 being a good idea. 

In today's lesson we all as a class were being too chatty when we weren't supposed to be. This was counterproductive to our learning.
