**Learning about Scratch**

Today in Computer science we were learning about Scratch. Scratch is a coding site where you use blocks to code. 

Here is the link:  [https://scratch.mit.edu/](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

I have been on Scratch a lot of times so I was very pleased that we were using a site that I've used before. Mr Keen let me start coding the game *space invaders *so I have been working on that this week.

This what I have so far: [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/186700331/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/186700331/) 

I hope you enjoy playing.
