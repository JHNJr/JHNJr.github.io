This week in Computer Science we continued with FUSE Basic. We were making our way through our booklets and some people managed to start making space invader sprites! I started adding variables and strings. Variables are a number or 'input' that stay the same until the user or programmer says otherwise. Strings are a sequence of numbers or letters and important characteristic of each string is its length can be any natural number for example 0 or any other positive number. I look forward to creating characters myself and

Starting my project next week.
