Today in IT we started with a new programming language which required a different HDMI cable. The programming language was called Fuse BASIC which needs a special keyboard and mouse to access it. The program itself is not dissimilar to Raspberry Pi but instead of on the chip the results show either on the monitor or the keyboard itself where there are compatible lights. Today we learned how to change the paper and ink colour, make a code go on forever and create variables. I found this code similar to others that I have used in the past so I managed to use my previous knowledge to solve the set tasks.

I hope to progress in this topic in other lessons so that at the end of term I can hand in a good piece of work.
