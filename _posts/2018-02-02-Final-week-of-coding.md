Final week of coding!!! I have nearly finished my game but there are still some problems with my game. Firstly I do not have any aliens yet because my code is/wrong, I will try to solve this ASAP. Secondly I have not programmed a shop yet so I will have to programme one very quickly. Also I do not have lives or an exit screen.

What I have done though is a title screen, an introduction and a working gun. 

Hopefully i can fix these things before next week.
