Today in computer science I was at a rehearsal so I don't know much about what we were doing but I found out from other people that we were learning about. What I found was that we were learning about e-safety and talked about grooming, a bit more on child exploitation and cyber bullying. We also learned about sex and how we like what they do but they might not feel the same way about what we post. Finally we talked about why under 16s are not allowed to have sex.
