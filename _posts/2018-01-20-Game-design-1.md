Game design 1

Today in ICT I was coding my game but when i pressed start, it didnt work! I was really annoyed with myself because i worked really hard on that piece. So i  made a copy and quickly found the problem. I eventually managed to bring the game back from the brink of deletion. 

I have only just started the game but i have made a strong start. Here is the link to it: [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/198116614/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/198116614/) 

 Like i said its not much but every journey starts with a single step.
